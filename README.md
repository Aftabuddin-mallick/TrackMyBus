# 🚌 TrackMyBus — Real-Time Bus Tracking System

**TrackMyBus** is a web-based application designed to help users track their buses in real time.  
It allows passengers to enter their **start** and **destination** locations and get route updates, current bus status, and estimated time of arrival (ETA).  

This project is built step-by-step using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with plans to integrate advanced features such as **Google Maps API, Node.js backend, MongoDB, and AI-based route predictions** in future updates.
